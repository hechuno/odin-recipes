        <h2>Beef noodle soup recipe</h2>
        <p>My favorite dish and the only thing I could order in China due to lack of vocabulary knowledge.</p>

                <li>bean paste</li>
                <li>soy sauce</li>

            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot with about 6 quarts (5 Â½ L) of water and add the beef shank, 3 scallions, 5 slices of ginger, and 3 star anise pods. Cover, bring to a boil over high heat, and cook for 5 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Remove the meat from the pot, rinse in cold water, and cut into thick slices. Discard the cooking liquid.</li><br>
                <li>In a wok or large pan over medium-high heat, pour in the vegetable oil and add the remaining 3 scallions, 3 ginger slices, the garlic, red chiles, remaining 3 star anise pods, the onion, rock sugar, and spicy bean paste. Cook until the onions start to become translucent.</li><br>
                <li>Add the sliced beef.</li><br>
                <li>Add the dark soy sauce, for color, stir, then add the rice wine.</li><br>
                <li>Pour in the light soy sauce, for flavor, then add the tomatoes. Stir fry for 8-10 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Fill the same large pot about a quarter of the way with water and heat over medium-high heat. Add the stir-fried meat, vegetables, and cooking liquid.</li><br>
                <li>Add more water until the meat is just covered, then add the white pepper, salt, and bay leaves. Cover and reduce the heat to low and simmer for at least 2 hours, until the meat becomes tender. Remove the bay leaves and star anise before serving.</li><br>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat and cook the flour noodles according to the package instructions. Remove the noodles from the water.</li><br>
                <li>Add the bok choy to the boiling water. Cook for 3 minutes, then remove.</li><br>
                <li>To assemble the soup, place a generous amount of noodles in the bottom of a bowl. Then, add bok choy, meat, and broth. Garnish with scallions, cilantro, and red chilies.</li><br>
